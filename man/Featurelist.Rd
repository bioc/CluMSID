\description{
\code{Featurelist} generates a \code{data.frame} that contains feature ID,
precurosur \emph{m/z} and retention time for all features contained in a
list of \code{MS2spectrum} objects as produced by \code{extractMS2spectra}
and \code{mergeSpecList}. \code{Featurelist} is used internally by
\code{\link{writeFeaturelist}}.
